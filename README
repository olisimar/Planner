Planner
A school project I made for planning projects in SCRUM.
I got the project form explained to me by a teacher which explains
some of the more funny things like tasks being stories etc. I guess
it all makes sense if you simply exchange task with stories in all
the places. Tasks are simply not entered anywhere. I guess I'll have
to fix that at some point when I have time.
There are two more views that are supposed to be in the database.
I somehow managed to break them when porting between phpMyAdmin and
MySQL admin. Another thing to fix, they are control the views that
the app produces for you. You can still see the project view and from
their you'll get the general gist of it I hope.
